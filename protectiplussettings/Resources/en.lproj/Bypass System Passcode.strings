"BYPASS_SYSTEM_PASSCODE_FOOTERTEXT" = "Protecti+ depends on Mobile Substrate, so anyone can disable Protecti+ entirely by holding down Volume Up as device boots. To protect your privacy, you may prefer set system passcode in Application Settings -> General -> Passcode Lock. However, it is so boring to enter passcode every time. Now, you can enable Bypass Passcode to avoid doing this and just let Protecti+ protect your device. This feature is implemented carefully, every time you reboot device you have to enter passcode at the first time, and remote lock by Find My iPhone also causes the need to input passcode.";
